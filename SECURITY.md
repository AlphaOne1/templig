Supported Versions
------------------

| Version        | Supported          |
|----------------|--------------------|

| releases 0.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| other branches | :x:                |

As this project uses semantic versioning, it is safe to upgrade to a later minor version,
i.e. an upgrade from v0.3.0 to v0.7.0 is without worries.


Reporting a Vulnerability
-------------------------

In case of a vulnerability contact the maintainer of the project.

Vulnerabilities should be treated confidential during a period of at most 90 days.
This finishes earlier, if there is a fix made available.

This project has private reporting enabled, follow the instructions
[here](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability).

Fixed vulnerabilities are to be included in the CHANGELOG and contain
also (if not otherwise requested) the name of the reporter of said vulnerability.
